# ParkEase Pro

ParkEase Pro is an AI-powered smart parking system designed to streamline parking management. It automatically calculates parking fees using ANPR technology to detect vehicle number plates, track entry-exit times, and determine parking duration-based charges. The system provides real-time monitoring, detects cars using AI, and identifies empty parking spots to ensure a hassle-free experience for users. By displaying occupied and available slots, it reduces manual errors and makes the parking process more efficient and accurate.

## Problem

Traditional parking systems are inefficient and time-consuming. Drivers often spend a lot of time searching for an empty parking space, leading to congestion in the parking lot. Additionally, traditional parking systems can be difficult to manage, and parking lot operators may struggle to keep track of occupancy rates and collect payments.

## Solution

ParkEase Pro can address these challenges by automating the parking process and providing real-time information to drivers and parking lot operators. The system can use cameras and image processing algorithms to detect the presence of cars and identify empty parking spaces. This information can then be used to direct drivers to available spaces and to calculate parking charges based on the length of time they are parked.
